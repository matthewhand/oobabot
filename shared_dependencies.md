1. "src/oobabot/main.py": This file is likely the main entry point of the application. It may import and use functions from "utils.py", "channel.py", and "llm.py". It may also share global variables or configurations with these files.

2. "src/oobabot/utils.py": This file likely contains utility functions that are used across the application. It may export functions that are used in "main.py", "channel.py", and "llm.py". 

3. "src/oobabot/channel.py": This file likely manages channel-related operations. It may export a function to get the current channel topic, which is used in "main.py" and "llm.py". 

4. "src/oobabot/llm.py": This file likely manages operations related to the "llm". It may export a function to prefix the prompt to the "llm", which is used in "main.py". 

Shared Dependencies:

1. Function Names: "get_current_channel_topic" (from "channel.py"), "prefix_prompt_to_llm" (from "llm.py"), and possibly utility functions from "utils.py".

2. Variables: Any global variables or configurations shared across the files.

3. Data Schemas: If there are data structures being shared across these files, their schemas would be a shared dependency. For example, the structure of a "channel" or "llm" object.
